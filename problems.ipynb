    "The Lady Tasting Tea experiment is a randomised experiment devised by Ronald Fisher (*The Design of Experiments* (1935)). In the experiment, 8 randomly ordered cups of tea are prepared: 4 of those cups of tea are prepared with milk followed by tea and 4 get tea first followed by milk. A participant claims they can distinguish the 2 sets of cups of tea from one another without seeing them being prepared.\n",

    "A t-test is a statistical test used to determine whether the means of two groups are significantly different from each other. It compares the difference between group means relative to the variation within the groups. By calculating a t value and its corresponding p value, the test helps assess whether an observed difference is likely due to chance or reflects a real effect (see [Laerd Statistics](https://statistics.laerd.com/statistical-guides/independent-t-test-statistical-guide.php) for further information).\n",
