    "\n",
    "The Lady Tasting Tea experiment is a randomised experiment devised by Ronald Fisher in which 8 randomly ordered cups of tea are prepared: 4 of those cups of tea are prepared with milk followed by tea and 4 get tea first followed by milk. A participant claims they can distinguish the 2 sets of cups of tea from one another without seeing them being prepared.\n",
    "\n",
    "The null hypothesis of the experiment is that the subject drinking the tea is not able to distinguish whether the cup they are drinking from had the tea or milk poured in it first.\n",
